# Benchmarking-protein-structures-predicted-by-AlphaFold-and-RosettaFold

Todo list

- [ ] Determine all loop regions based of the PDB structure. You could use tools like DSSP (Hint: Take a look at biotite.application.dssp for a convenient interface to the soft- ware DSSP; DSSP has to be installed separately).
- [ ] Write code to align loop regions from model and X-ray structure and compute RMSD
- [ ] Systematically analyze RMSDs between both prediction methods, analyze w.r.t to other parameters (e.g., loop length, adjacent secondary structures)
- [ ] Visualize your results
- [ ] Bonus: Compute the GDT_TS score globally for all structures
- [ ] Report
